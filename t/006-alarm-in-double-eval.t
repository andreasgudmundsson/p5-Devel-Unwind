# Before I added code to cleanup the context stack after resuming execution
# the my custom return op I noted the following:
#
# Execution jumps from [C] to [A] I believe this means we need to at least
# pop the context blocks we've jumped past, [B] is gettings its cx->blk_eval.retop
# from the eval context of [A]
